## Project Overview

This is the 6th project accomplished as a part of Udacity Front-End Nanodegree and uses HTML5, CSS and JavaScript (ES6). The starter code was provided by Udacity.

The task was to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application by:

- making the site fully responsive without using any CSS framework
- implementing accessibility features in the site HTML
- adding a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline.
